## yew-services-compat

Yew commit `yew-v0.19.3~162` removed yew-services support.

The reason given by maintainers is described here: [From 0.18.0 to 0.19.0 | Yew](https://yew.rs/docs/migration-guides/yew/from-0_18_0-to-0_19_0).

This crate brings them back and makes them compatible to 0.19.0.

Reason I did this: took less time than adapting to alternative libraries.
